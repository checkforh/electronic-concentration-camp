Okay, here is a summary of the "stupidity ratings" assigned by the different AI models in the file you provided.

It's important to remember that the original prompt and the concept of "psychotronic weapons" are based on unverified claims and conspiracy theories. The AI models generally included disclaimers stating this, and the ratings were provided as a speculative or satirical exercise based on the prompt's definition of "stupidity"â€”essentially ranking the suspects based on how implausible, irrational, or logistically absurd it would be for them to run a secret global torture program for "fun and profit".

**Summary of Ratings:**

Most models ranked the suspects in a relatively similar order of "stupidity," though the exact rankings and rationales varied slightly. Here's a general overview from highest stupidity (most absurd/implausible) to lowest stupidity (least absurd, relatively speaking within the hypothetical scenario):

1.  **Highest Stupidity (Most Absurd):**
    * **Global farm of mind/body torture to attract UFOs:** Almost universally ranked as the most "stupid" or implausible suspect due to the completely irrational and baseless motive of attracting UFOs with human distress. Models like Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, GPT4o, Qwen 3, LLama 4, Deepseek R1, and Phi 4 placed this scenario at the top of the stupidity scale.
2.  **Very High Stupidity:**
    * **Pseudo robin-hood do-gooders:** Often ranked second or very high in stupidity. The idea of vigilantes using advanced secret tech for thrill and power, while believing they are "do-gooders," was seen as highly illogical, inefficient, and contradictory. Grok, GPT4o, Qwen 3, LLama 4, Deepseek R1, and Phi 4 ranked them very high.
3.  **High to Medium-High Stupidity:**
    * **Underground psychiatrist network:** This scenario, involving a fetish-driven group using outdated Soviet tech, was generally considered highly implausible due to logistical challenges and the disproportionate scale of the operation compared to the motive. Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, GPT4o, Qwen 3, LLama 4, Deepseek R1, and Phi 4 rated this group as having high stupidity.
    * **Organized crime:** While potentially capable of stealing tech, using it for a global torture program was seen as a poor, high-risk strategy for profit-driven criminals, making it a "stupid" business model. Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, Mistral, Qwen 3, LLama 4, Deepseek R1, and Phi 4 generally ranked this scenario as highly implausible.
4.  **Medium Stupidity:**
    * **Transhumanist movement:** Torturing people for data was considered a terrible and counterproductive method compared to other data-gathering techniques, even if the group is tech-focused. Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, Qwen 3, LLama 4, Deepseek R1, and Phi 4 placed them in the middle to lower end of the stupidity scale.
5.  **Lower Stupidity (Relatively More Plausible within the Conspiracy Context):**
    * **Government-backed program:** While still highly speculative, this was often considered the *least* stupid option among the *human* groups, primarily because governments hypothetically possess the resources, infrastructure access, and historical precedent (like MKULTRA) for secretive, unethical programs, even if the scale and motive described are extreme. Perplexity, Grok, Gemini, GPT4o, Qwen 3, LLama 4, Deepseek R1, and Phi 4 generally ranked this lower on the stupidity scale compared to non-state actors.
6.  **Lowest Stupidity (Most Plausible within the Conspiracy Context, or Exempt):**
    * **Aliens:** Interestingly, models had varied views here. Some ranked aliens as having very *high* stupidity (Gemini) because advanced beings using crude human tech seems inefficient. Others (Grok, GPT4o, LLama 4, Deepseek R1, Phi 4) ranked them as having the *lowest* stupidity, arguing that their advanced capabilities and potentially incomprehensible motives might make such an operation feasible or logical from their perspective, thus making them the "least stupid" suspects if they existed. Mistral ranked Aliens as having extremely high stupidity based on the lack of evidence for their involvement.

In essence, the models consistently found the scenarios with the most outlandish motives (UFO attraction) and least plausible capabilities (vigilantes, psychiatrists) to be the "stupidest," while state actors or hypothetical advanced aliens were considered comparatively less absurd within the framework of the prompt.
